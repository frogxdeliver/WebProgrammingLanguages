# WebProgrammingLanguages

For the first tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vs?view=aspnetcore-2.1
The web application doesn't do anything different from a default webApplication, but it does have the functionality of a database and it connects to azure.

It was just about creating a web application with azure. The only difference I did from the tutorial is use a free version, because I wasn't sure about the cost. I also changed the index page like it said, however I believe it was saved as something different in the tutorial since it was made about 6+ months ago.

# WebProgrammingLanguages

#Part 1:
For the first tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vs?view=aspnetcore-2.1
The web application doesn't do anything different from a default webApplication, but it does have the functionality of a database and it connects to azure.

It was just about creating a web application with azure. The only difference I did from the tutorial is use a free version, because I wasn't sure about the cost. I also changed the index page like it said, however I believe it was saved as something different in the tutorial since it was made about 6+ months ago.

#Part 2:
From this tutorial I grew more familiar with git and the azure interface. I haven't created a user, database, and password from the command line before, which surprised me how easy it was when using azure.

There wasn't too many steps, but since I mis-typed one line I ended up having to redo it again. Also, for some reason when I try connecting to the site when it isn't running locally, I end up getting an error with the page. I looked it up, but I'm unsure exactly how to fix it since the one I found didn't really help my issue.
